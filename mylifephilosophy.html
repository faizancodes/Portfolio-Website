      <p class="bodypara" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; line-height: 22pt;">Throughout my time in high school and college, I have been faced with countless challenges and experiences that have led me to develop a very philosophical outlook on life. As someone who strives for happiness and success, I have realized that those goals are completely misconceived nowadays, as people often lack a sense of purpose or direction in life that will lead them there. Its easy to become lost or feel insignificant in this ever-changing world but there are actions you can take to get back on track. Having found a direction and purpose in life, I hope this blog helps anyone in need of general advice. 
      </p>

      <p class="bodypara" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; line-height: 22pt;">Ever since my sophomore year in high school, I had a very clear idea of the career path I wished to embark on in the future. My roots in programming were formed in my Intro to Java class, where my passion was conspicuous. It was apparent that I had an innate ability to code and I made sure to help other students when they needed it. Throughout my experience in college, I realized how fortunate I was to have a clear passion and an idea of the field I wanted to go into at an early age. Several people I have met are either undecided majors or do not have a set career for post graduation, which made me realize what a blessing it was to be exposed to computer science in high school since it gave me a huge advantage in college. This leads into the first and perhaps one of the most important lessons I would like to share, which is that we learn about ourselves from practice, not theory. If you are someone who is struggling to decide what kind of job you want in the future or what field you want to get into, think about it like this: you don’t know what you like until you try it, just like how you don’t know what food you like until you taste it. Going out and trying different things is one of the best ways to develop an interest which can be turned into a career. It is crucial to remember that we learn best from experience, something that does not have any shortcuts and cannot be substituted.

      <p class="bodypara" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; line-height: 22pt;">Being an avid NBA fan has taught me several lessons about talent that can be applied to everyday life. We see players like LeBron James, Michael Jordan, and Kobe Bryant, who are undeniably gifted in terms of their stature and athleticism, but what people do not see is the work they put in behind the scenes. The fact of the matter is, when we watch basketball games, we are seeing the final product on the court, but all the training and practice that goes into it is what few people understand. It's no surprise that the greatest NBA players were also the hardest working. LeBron James is a once in a generation genetic freak but his work ethic is what delivers results on the court. From his strict diet to his unrivaled workouts, there is a reason why LeBron has consistently been one of the NBA’s best players for almost two decades. Kobe Bryant was notorious for having the most intense work ethic in the league, making over 2,000 shots a day in the offseason. One of the NBA’s most lethal scores, Kevin Durant said, “hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard.” This has led me to realize that talent is merely an illusion. Someone can be gifted in every sense but without the right work ethic, all that talent is useless. In retrospect, my innate ability to code can simply be attributed to the fact that I used to practice in my free time. I put in the work to learn java and go above and beyond what was taught in the classroom, something that few people were willing to do. So if you are struggling to do something while others have no issue with it, don’t be disheartened and remember to put in the work to practice, as that is what is going to make you successful, not mere talent.

      <p class="bodypara" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; line-height: 22pt;">When looking to people for inspiration and advice, it can be quite bizarre that the main person who comes to my mind was alive over 2000 years ago. His wisdom has greatly altered my mentality and has helped me find my direction and purpose in life. Socrates stated how “wisdom begins in wonder”, a statement that is so simple, yet so powerful. Developing a genuine intellectual curiosity can be one of the most beneficial aspects of one’s life. By chasing mastery, you are bound to find a passion. Socrates also stated how “true knowledge exists in knowing that you know nothing”, which truly resonates with me, given that I aspire to attain a Ph.D. in Computer Science and am motivated by the pursuit of knowledge. The fact of the matter is, technology is advancing at a rate that is difficult to keep up with so it is important to remain humble and never stop learning. One of the reasons why Kobe Bryant was so successful outside of basketball was because of his inquisitive nature and obsession with learning. He would pick apart entrepreneurs' minds, asking them about anything he didn't know, which is what allowed him to reach great success in the business world. The knowledge you have today can be obsolete by tomorrow. It is important to question your surroundings, ask yourself why things work the way they do. </p>
      
      
      <p class="bodypara" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; line-height: 22pt;">Failure and rejection are things that I have been particularly accustomed to. I was rejected by my dream college not once but twice. I’ve been rejected for more internships than I can count. I’ve failed multiple coding challenges and interviews, along with other tests. What most people don’t understand is that these small failures are the building blocks to a huge success. I would never let all my failures define me or bring me down, because the few successes I have had give me the confidence that I can achieve anything. Failure is inevitable, and it is necessary so you can learn from it. I’m only at this point now where I am able to help other students because of my failures. When looking for leaders in an industry, seek those who have failed the most. Elon Musk is one of the best examples of this. His company, SpaceX went from 3 failed launches to sending humans to space and landing a rocket autonomously on a ship in the middle of the ocean. Elon Musk said it himself, “And fortunately the fourth launch, which was, that was the last money that we had for Falcon 1. That fourth launch worked. Or it would have been — that would have been it for SpaceX.” Musk's other company, Tesla, was on the brink of bankruptcy at the height of the financial crisis. He expected the company to fail, and even opted for a $0 salary where he would only receive stock options from the company in the event that Tesla reaches a market capitalization of over $100 billion. Ever since then, Musk has gone through years of intense regulatory scrutiny from the SEC along with most of Wall Street doubting the profitabily of Tesla and expected the company to fail at anytime. In the face of adversity, Musk overcame all failures and proved everyone wrong. With Tesla's current market capitalization being over $440 billion, Musk's net worth has soared to over $100 billion, making him one of the fifth richest people in the world. I wanted to share his story because its how you react to failure that determines your future. Never let it discourage you from achieving your dreams.

      <p class="bodypara" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; line-height: 22pt;">Most people nowadays have one main goal in life: become rich. The common notion is that happiness will follow and that money will be the solution to all of their problems. Now, there is nothing wrong with wanting money, because if there is one thing that money can provide, its freedom. Having a sufficient amount of money can allow you to escape the gloomy 9-5 life and allow you to travel the world and do basically whatever you want whenever you want. However, if there is one thing that is almost certain, it's that more money comes with more problems. Due to the fact that we can always earn more money, some people are never content with their income as they feel like it's never enough. This greed can lead to severe mental illnesses as people who suffer with depression or anxiety disorders tend to think if they had more money they would be happier, but this couldn't be further from the truth. It has been shown that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/20/how-much-money-you-need-to-be-happy-according-to-wealth-experts.html">happiness increases with income up to $75K then plateaus</a> and some studies even suggest that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2015/01/26/why-the-super-successful-get-depressed/#1f3bd28f3850">rich kids are, counter-intuitively, more depressed and anxious than their middle- or low-income peers.</a> There are a ton of Hollywood actors and celebrities that despite their vast amounts of wealth, have committed suicide or face depression. Maintaining good mental health has been a difficult challenge for me and for certainly for a majority of other people as well. Opening up about your feelings can be very beneficial, so it is especially important to have very close relationships with a few friends who you can talk about it with, which has helped me tremendously. Nurturing these relationships can dramatically increase your happiness and well-being over the long term. Its important to remember that the happiest people don't have the best of everything, they just make the best of everything. Happiness doesn't depend on outward conditions, but rather inner conditions. It isn't what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. Its what you think about it. As Socrates stated, "He is richest who is content with the least, for content is the wealth of nature."

      <p class="bodypara" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; line-height: 22pt;">Ever since November 2018, I have been writing down everything I accomplish on a daily basis. So every night before I go to bed, I always write down whatever I did for that day and my goals for the next day. This has significantly increased my productivity and it provides structure to my life. So whenever I wake up in the morning, I know exactly what I’m going to be working on later which eliminates time wasted contemplating what to do out of boredom. The fact of the matter is, the secret to success can be found in your daily routine. Everyone in the world has the same 24 hours to spend, and the way you spend it determines your future. By dedicating just 30 mins a day to reading a book, the extra knowledge you would have acquired over the course of a year would be astounding. After almost 2 years of journaling, I can say for certain that it has helped me accomplish way more than I ever thought I could. It has been especially beneficial over the course of quarantine, due to the fact that I worked on several different projects at a time and writing down what I did each day helped me track my progress. 
        </p>

      <p class="bodypara" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; line-height: 22pt;"> Throughout college, I learned that by converting things that I have to do into things that I want to do, I will find satisfaction. For example, in order to land an internship, I have to keep improving my skills in order to be a great candidate for the company. Due to my general curiosity and desire to be a better person everyday, I find myself wanting to improve my skills, rather than having an obligation to. This simple change in mentality can be applied to any kind of work you have to do and it will greatly benefit your productivity. If you find yourself having trouble finding the motivation to work on an assignment or anything else that you would rather not do, keep an open mind and remember that you can learn something valuable from it. Make the assignment something that you want to work on rather than something you have to work on and you will have an easier time completing it.
